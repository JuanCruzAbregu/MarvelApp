# **Marvel app**
## Functionality
At the moment the app retrieves a list of heroes from the marvel api and displays them in a RecyclerView.

If you click on a hero, it will take you to a new screen where you can see more details about the selected hero.I decided to put just some details of the hero and a list of the comics he appears in inside another RecyclerView.

## Future Goals
Although the app came from a challenge, I intend to continue adding features and other things like dagger, some animations, and a better presentation of the ui.

## Warning
*There is data of some heroes that the api does not have (images, descriptions or list of comics).*
